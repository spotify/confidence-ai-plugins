# Confidence Plugin

This plugin integrates Confidence with Claude Code, providing tools for feature flag management, experimentation, and migration from other platforms.

## Commands

- `/confidence:migrate-posthog <plan flag | plan code | execute <plan-file>>` — Migrate feature flags from PostHog to Confidence SDK
- `/confidence:migrate-eppo <plan flag | plan code | execute <plan-file>>` — Migrate feature flags from Eppo to Confidence SDK
- `/confidence:migrate-statsig <plan flag | execute <plan-file>>` — Migrate feature flag definitions from Statsig to Confidence (Phase 1; code transformation ships separately)
